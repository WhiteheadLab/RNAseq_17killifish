[2019-07-21 18:17:19.024] [jointLog] [info] Usage of --validateMappings implies use of minScoreFraction. Since not explicitly specified, it is being set to 0.65
[2019-07-21 18:17:19.024] [jointLog] [info] Usage of --validateMappings, without --hardFilter implies use of range factorization. rangeFactorizationBins is being set to 4

[2019-07-21 18:19:22.663] [jointLog] [info] Counted 16,663,632 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-07-21 18:19:22.695] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000882285% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
