[2019-07-21 17:47:10.253] [jointLog] [info] Counted 11,675,891 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-07-21 17:47:10.284] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00134239% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
