[2019-07-21 17:54:49.472] [jointLog] [info] Counted 14,270,312 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-07-21 17:54:49.501] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00134592% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
