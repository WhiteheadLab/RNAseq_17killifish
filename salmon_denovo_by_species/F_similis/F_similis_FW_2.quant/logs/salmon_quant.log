[2019-07-21 17:54:42.954] [jointLog] [info] Usage of --validateMappings implies use of minScoreFraction. Since not explicitly specified, it is being set to 0.65
[2019-07-21 17:54:42.954] [jointLog] [info] Usage of --validateMappings, without --hardFilter implies use of range factorization. rangeFactorizationBins is being set to 4
[2019-07-21 17:54:42.954] [jointLog] [info] Usage of --validateMappings implies a default consensus slack of 0.2. Setting consensusSlack to 0.2.

[2019-07-21 17:55:39.531] [jointLog] [info] Computed 483,017 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-07-21 17:55:39.532] [jointLog] [info] Counted 7,465,888 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-07-21 17:55:39.560] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00149056% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
