[2019-07-21 18:00:12.008] [jointLog] [info] Usage of --validateMappings implies use of minScoreFraction. Since not explicitly specified, it is being set to 0.65
[2019-07-21 18:00:12.008] [jointLog] [info] Usage of --validateMappings, without --hardFilter implies use of range factorization. rangeFactorizationBins is being set to 4
[2019-07-21 18:00:12.008] [jointLog] [info] Usage of --validateMappings implies a default consensus slack of 0.2. Setting consensusSlack to 0.2.

[2019-07-21 18:01:12.590] [jointLog] [info] Counted 8,478,057 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-07-21 18:01:12.619] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00124693% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
