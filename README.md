# RNAseq_15killifish

**This is repository is a WORK IN PROGRESS**

Differential expression analysis with RNAseq data from 16 species of Fundulus killifish following a salinity exposure experiment (FW, BW, transfer). 

*De novo* transcriptome assemblies and annotations for each species are located here:
